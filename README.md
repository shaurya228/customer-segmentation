Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering<br>
This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their shared characteristics and behaviors. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, will be employed to discover these natural groupings within the customer data.<br>

Project Goals<br>
Identify Customer Segments: Discover meaningful customer segments that exhibit similar patterns in their attributes and behaviors.<br>
Understand Segment Characteristics: Analyze the key characteristics of each segment, such as demographics, purchase history, or loan repayment behavior.<br>
Tailor Strategies: Develop targeted marketing campaigns, product offerings, or risk assessment models based on the unique needs and preferences of each segment.<br>
Methodology<br>
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather relevant customer data, including demographic information, transaction history, and any other relevant attributes. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.<br>

Feature Engineering: Select and transform relevant features that capture customer characteristics and behaviors. Consider creating new features or combining existing ones to enhance the clustering process.<br>

K-means Clustering: Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to the data, experimenting with different numbers of clusters (K) to find the optimal segmentation.<br>

Segment Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each segment, identifying key distinguishing factors and potential implications for business strategies.<br>

Visualization: Visualize the segments using techniques like scatter plots or heatmaps to gain further insights into their distribution and relationships.<br>

Potential Applications (in the context of loan approval)<br>
Risk Assessment: Segment customers based on their creditworthiness and financial stability to tailor loan offerings and interest rates.<br>
Targeted Marketing: Develop personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments based on their needs and preferences.<br>
Product Development: Identify opportunities for new products or services that cater to the specific needs of different customer segments.<br>
